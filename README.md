# Property Price Prediction Model

This is a property price prediction model developed using Python and various machine learning packages. The model is designed to predict the sale prices of properties based on a variety of features, both categorical (location) and numerical (size, no of bedrooms, age...). 

## Models Used

The following models were trained and evaluated as part of this project:

- Linear Regression
- XGBoost
- Light GBM

## Data

The data for this project was sourced from the public house price prediction dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata). The dataset includes a variety of features for a large number of properties, as well as the sale price for each property.

## Results

The testing R2 for this model is 77%, which indicates a high degree of accuracy.

## Use

This model is intended to be used by real estate professionals, investors, and other stakeholders to help forecast and understand the housing market. It can be used to make informed decisions about buying, selling, and investing in property.
